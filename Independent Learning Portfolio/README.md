# Independent Learning Portfolio

This repository is where I track my **ongoing learning and skill development**.  
It includes notes, summaries, labs, and projects from multiple courses I take over time.

## Purpose
- Record course progress and key takeaways.
- Store sanitized notes, scripts, and lab work.
- Showcase my continuous self-directed learning.

## Structure
Each course has its own folder with:
- `README.md` → module summaries and key points
- `notes.md` → detailed notes or commands
- `scripts/` → personal scripts or tools
- `screenshots/` → optional visual evidence

## Progress
- Tracked in `PROGRESS.md` for each course and module.
